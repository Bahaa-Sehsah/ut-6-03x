This repository contains all labs of the course UTAustinX: UT.6.03x Embedded Systems - Shape the World



## About the Course

This course is instructed by Prof. Jonathan Valvano and Dr. Ramesh Yerraballi and can be found [here](https://edx.org/course/embedded-systems-shape-world-utaustinx-ut-6-03x).



## About My Labs

From **Lab02-HelloLaunchPad** to **Lab14-AnalogDigitalConversion** and an additional **Lab16-IoT**, I got 100 out of 100 points on simulator and real board graders.  
Only **Lab15-SpaceInvaders** is unfinished due to my lack of graphic processing skills. I will come back and complete it in the near future.



## Software and Kit Requirements

To be able to debug and upload these projects to the LaunchPad, follow the instruction in [Software Requirements.pdf](/Software%20Requirements.pdf) and [Kit Requirements.pdf](/Kit%20Requirements.pdf). Click [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_BEuwvumKEUVURXRm5nRmZsWmM) to download **Keil uVision 4** and **TExaSware**.
