# ut-6-03x

This repository contains my solutions to the labs of the course [UTAustinX: UT.6.03x Embedded Systems - Shape the World](https://edx.org/course/embedded-systems-shape-world-utaustinx-ut-6-03x) during Spring 2016 session.

**Update**: As of 2017, the course is split into two parts: [UT.6.10x Microcontroller Input/Output](https://www.edx.org/course/embedded-systems-shape-world-utaustinx-ut-6-10x) and [UT.6.20x Multi-Threaded Interfacing](https://www.edx.org/course/embedded-systems-shape-world-multi-utaustinx-ut-6-20x).
