# ut-6-03x

This repository contains all labs of the course UTAustinX: UT.6.03x Embedded Systems - Shape the World



## About the Course

This course is instructed by Prof. Jonathan Valvano and Dr. Ramesh Yerraballi and can be found [here](https://edx.org/course/embedded-systems-shape-world-utaustinx-ut-6-03x).



## About My Labs

From **Lab02-HelloLaunchPad** to **Lab14-AnalogDigitalConversion** and an additional **Lab16-IoT**, I got 100 out of 100 points on simulator and real board graders.  
Only **Lab15-SpaceInvaders** is currently unfinished due to my lack of graphic processing skills. I will come back and complete it in the near future.

For detailed information, see my lab progress [blog](https://philectron.github.io/tags/#ut-6-03x).



## Software and Kit Requirements
